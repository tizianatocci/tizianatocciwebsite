        <h1> Tiziana Tocci</h1>
        <p><em>PhD Candidate at <a href="https://curie.fr/">Institut Curie</a></em>, Paris. </p>
        <p>Young researcher enthusiastic about subjects at the interface between biology and informatics. <br>
          I am currently conducting my doctoral project at Institut Curie, 
          under the supervision of Herv&eacute; Isambert and Pascal Hersen. <br>
          By using novel causal discovery algorithms developed in the <a href="http://kinefold.curie.fr/isambertlab/">Isambert laboratory</a>, 
          our aim is to unconver the causal-effect relationships that govern 
          the complex biological systems under study. <br>
          Specifically, I analyze cell microscopy videos and single cell transcriptomics data 
          in order to extract features/variables of interest and uncover the association 
          and causality between these properties. <br>
          I am inclined to work in scientific international environments and 
          to participate into the organization of scientific events 
          (member of the Young Researchers' Seminars committee of my research unit).</p>

  <h3>My journey</h3>
  <p>I was born and raised in Rome. <br>
  Since middle school I have always enjoyed Maths and Sciences, therefore I continued my studies in a scientific high school. <br>
  It was soon clear to be that I wanted to study Engineering applied to healthcare and I obtained my Bachelor's degree and my Master's degree in Medical Engineering at Tor Vergata University of Rome. <br>
  During my Master's, I discovered my passion about programming applied to solve medical and biological problems. <br>
  I got familiar with Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Image Analysis while studying programming languages in university and with online courses. <br>
  I followed a Data Analyst Academy at Avanade and I worked a few months as a Data Analyst because of my interest towards data analysis in industry. <br>
  I decided to pursue a doctorate in medical/biological research because of three main reasons: I wanted to deepen my knowledge of data analysis applied to the medical field, I feel that research is a field where you never stop learning and I strongly attribuite a noble value to medical research. <br>
  Moreover, I decided to pursue my PhD abroad because I wanted to go beyond the borders of what was my world at the time. <br>
  I succedeed in becoming a PhD Candidate at Institut Curie, I am part of the <a href="https://training.institut-curie.org/eureca">EuReCa PhD Program</a> (Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Actions). <br>
  In the future, I would like to work at the interface between research and industry in an international and stimulating environment. </p>
